            A battling left-handed opening batsman, Hewett could post a large score in a short time against even the best bowlers. 
            Capable of hitting the ball powerfully, he combined an excellent eye with an unorthodox style to be regarded at his peak as one of England's finest batsmen. 
            Educated at Harrow School, Hewett won a blue at Oxford in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. In 1892, he made 1,407 runs at an average of more than 35, and was named as one of the "Five Batsmen of the Year" by Wisden in 1893. 
            England did not play any Test matches at home in 1892, or else Hewett would probably have won a Test cap; instead his highest accolade was being selected to play for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's in 1894. </p>
